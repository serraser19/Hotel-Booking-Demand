# Hotel-Booking-Demand

### Context:
A hotel company wants to establish a pricing policy for reservation cancellation insurance. For this, they would like to know in advance the probability that a reservation will be canceled when it is made. For this, a dataset is available with a historical set of reservations, with some attributes that characterize each of them and a column that indicates whether that reservation was canceled prematurely (is_cancelled).
